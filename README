INTRODUCTION
____________

This directory contains version 2.3.0 of the LuMP recording package.

LuMP (LOFAR und MPIfR Pulsare) is a software package for recording
beamformed data from LOFAR station in single-station mode.  The LuMP
recording software is intended to be a minimalistic software package
to handle basic reformatting and recording of LOFAR beamformed data.
At the moment, the only significant processing incorporated in LuMP is
the option to channelize and/or integrate data for some output
formats.  As data processing is kept to a minimum, LuMP has relatively
low requirements on CPU capacity.  However, recording the output data
from a LOFAR station (approximately 100 MB/s per RSP lane, with 4 RSP
lanes) may require significant sustained throughput capacity from the
computer and storage device.

LuMP v2.3.0 includes several new recording formats:

    LuMP1:  pulsar recording format for processing with dspsr that can
            output multiple beamlets per file
    FFT0, PFB0:  discrete Fourier transform and polyphase filterbank
            channelization of the LOFAR beamlet data
    P_FFT0, P_PFB0:  power (as opposed to raw voltage) recording
            formats using Fourier transform and polyphase filterbank
            channelization

LuMP v2.3.0 also includes a number of bugfixes from the v2.2 release.

Using LuMP
__________

Please see the LuMP website at

Licensing
_________

Please see the file COPYING for detailed copyright information.

LuMP is free software (see the file COPYING).  Users are encouraged to
reference the latest refereed publication documenting LuMP (journal
article in progress as of 2014-09-23).  There is no compulsion to
include the developer(s) as co-authors on publications from using LuMP
after 2014-09-23, but feel fre to contact me(us) if you would like to
do so.  If you have feature requests, please let me know.  Significant
development work might be possible to purchase through co-authorship.
Actual money might get even faster results.  :)
