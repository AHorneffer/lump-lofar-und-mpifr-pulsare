# 2014 Sep 23  JMA  --- LuMP v2.3.0
This version fixes some bugs from the previous version (including the
bug that Stefan reported about a week ago --- fixed in my version for
several months now).  A full ChangeLog is still in progress.  However,
here is a list of major subsystems:

*** Pulsar recording: There are no significant changes here, except
    for minor bug fixes that have not affected the data actually going
    into dspsr.  The system still supports outputting subbands to disk
    separately (LuMP0), groups of subbands to disk (LuMP1), and piping
    the data directly into dspsr with no storage to disk (LuMP2).

*** VDIF: a new writing mode has been enabled for writing out the
    LOFAR beamformed data in the VLBI Data Interchange Format (VDIF),
    so that correlating GLOW data with something like DiFX should be
    made a bit easier.  (DiFX will still need to be modified to
    understand the exact form of VDIF that I have implemented, as
    LOFAR beamformed data break some of the rules of the VDIF format
    requirements, but...)

*** Channelization: Multiple modes for performing channelization and
    optionally to convert the voltage data to power and integrate over
    arbitrary lengths of time have been enabled and tested (as far as
    I can without access to a real datastream).  Both FFT and PFB
    implementations are available (you probably want the PFB
    implementation to deal with RFI leakage), with a huge assortment
    of weighting functions to choose from for both.  On my 4 core
    i5-2500K system at home (computer from 2011), I can generate 16
    channels per subband for all subbands in a LOFAR station lane (1/4
    of the whole station) in faster than real time for both the 16 and
    8 bit modes for the PFB integrating to power mode.  Processing 244
    subbands for the 4 bit mode takes about 15% longer than the length
    of time of the input data on my home computer, so it is also close
    to being realtime.  For the lofarBN and lofarCN machines at the
    MPIfR, there should be no problem in being able to keep up with
    realtime for the 4 bit mode with 16 channels per subband.  As the
    lofarAN machines are a bit older but have more cores, I cannot
    predict whether or not they will be able to keep up.  The
    channelization output modes of LuMP might be interesting for the
    Solar group to get the resolution they want for single station
    observations, as my version of LuMP can easily do << 100 kHz
    frequency resolution and 1 ms integration times.  Other options
    (looking for carbon lines, ...) might be possible too.







# 2013 Sep 22  JMA  --- LuMP v2.0 alpha

LuMP is now in its v2.0 alpha release stage.

New features in v2.0:

    New recording formats:

        LuMP1:  pulsar recording format for processing with dspsr that can
                output multiple beamlets per file
        FFT0:   discrete Fourier transform channelization of LOFAR beamlet data
        PFB0:   polyphase filterbank channelization of LOFAR beamlet data
        P_FFT0: power (as opposed to raw voltage) recording
            	format using Fourier transform channelization
        P_PFB0: power (as opposed to raw voltage) recording
            	format using polyphase filterbank channelization

    The logging system has been extensively modified

    Each beamlet may be assigned a separate RCUMODE value, as opposed
    to LuMP v1.0 which assumed that all beamlets had the same
    RCUMODE.  This allows multiple RCUMODEs to be recorded
    simultaneously (such as the LOFAR 357 mode).

    Pointing directions and epoch information for each beamlet are now
    provided to the program, and recorded for output formats that
    support them.


Bugfixes in v2.0:

    The reference epoch was off by 1.0 seconds (exactly) in LuMP v1.0
    when LuMP was started on an odd second using the 200 MHz sampling
    mode of the LOFAR station.
