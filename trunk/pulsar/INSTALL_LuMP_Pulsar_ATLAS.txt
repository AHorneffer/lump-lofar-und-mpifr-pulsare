Notes on downloading ATLAS:

As of 2014-09-26, the SourceForge web area still has ATLAS 3.10 listed
as the "Stable" version.  However, looking in the documentation, you
will see that the ATLAS developers consider version 3.10 to be
hopelessly out of date, and you should try to install the latest
"Developer" version (3.11.??) and get that working instead.  As of
this time, version 3.11.30 is available.

Downloading the tarball versions from SourceForge seems to require
that you browse with a web browser.  So, I have attempted to start a
web browser to open the correct starting web page for you.  If that
has not worked, then point a browser yourself manually to

http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/


From there, navigate to the "Software" section.  Click on the
"Developer (unstable)" link.  Then click on the 3.11.30 link.  Then
click on the atlas3.11.30.tar.bz2 link.  Save the file to your hard
drive, and move it to the directory indicated in the message text on
the terminal you were using to install LuMP.  Then close this editor
session.  LuMP will then check that you have installed the correct
file at the correct directory.
