Notes on downloading PSRXML:

Downloading the tarball versions from GitHub seems to require
that you browse with a web browser.  So, I have attempted to start a
web browser to open the correct starting web page for you.  If that
has not worked, then point a browser yourself manually to

http://github.com/SixByNine/psrxml/tree/master


From there, click on the Download ZIP link.  Save the file to your
hard drive, and move it to the directory indicated in the message text
on the terminal you were using to install LuMP.  Then close this
editor session.  LuMP will then check that you have installed the
correct file at the correct directory.
