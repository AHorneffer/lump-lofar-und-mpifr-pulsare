Notes on downloading SIGPROC:

Downloading the tarball versions from SourceForge seems to require
that you browse with a web browser.  So, I have attempted to start a
web browser to open the correct starting web page for you.  If that
has not worked, then point a browser yourself manually to

http://sigproc.sourceforge.net/


From there, scroll down to the "Installng SIGPROC" area.  Click on the
"here" link in "Download the latest version of SIGPROC here".  The
sigproc-4.3.tar.gz file should then be available for download.  Save
the file to your hard drive, and move it to the directory indicated in
the message text on the terminal you were using to install LuMP.  Then
close this editor session.  LuMP will then check that you have
installed the correct file at the correct directory.
