This package provides recording software for the beamformed data produced by an individual LOFAR station (telescope).  The astronomical telescope part of LOFAR is an array of low-frequency (10--240 MHz) stations constructed in Europe.  Each station can transmit about 3.2 Gb/s of data observed in the beamformed data mode of operation of the stations.  This software provides a means for astronomers with access to an individual LOFAR station or collection of stations to receive the UDP data packets transmitted by the station, converting the raw LOFAR data to other data formats, and to write out the data to storage for future processing.
