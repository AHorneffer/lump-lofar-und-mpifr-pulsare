Notes on downloading TEMPO2:

Downloading the tarball versions from SourceForge seems to require
that you browse with a web browser.  So, I have attempted to start a
web browser to open the correct starting web page for you.  If that
has not worked, then point a browser yourself manually to

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pulsarhunter/files/


Click on the "Download pulsarhunter_v1.3r63.tar.gz (12.0 MB)" link.
Save the file to your hard drive, and move it to the directory
indicated in the message text on the terminal you were using to
install LuMP.  Then close this editor session.  LuMP will then check
that you have installed the correct file at the correct directory.
